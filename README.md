## Front-end Test

This is a simple CRUD application for managing a user list using `localStorage`. It includes a form with validation for Brazilian-specific fields (CPF and phone number), unit tests for the core logic, and a styled UI using MUI.

### Overview

There are two main routes:

- `/`: Displays the list of users.
- `/criar-ou-editar`: Contains the form to create or edit users.
- (plus) `/criar-ou-editar/[email]`: A dynamic route used for editing a specific user by their email.

### Using StorageManager

[StorageManager](./services/storage-manager.ts) abstracts common operations like read, edit, and delete using a Map() allowing efficient data management, which could be used for another services similar to [UserService](./services/user.service.ts).

To manage user data via `localStorage`, we use a class called `StorageManager`, which wraps the data in a `Map()` and allows common CRUD operations. It requires a unique key to identify each object (in this case, the user's email):

```ts
const PROPERTY_TO_KEY_FAKE_PRIMARY_KEY = 'email'
new StorageManager(LOCALSTORAGE_KEY, PROPERTY_TO_KEY_FAKE_PRIMARY_KEY)
```

#### **UI & Validations**

The UI is built with Material UI (MUI) for its flexibility and easy customization. The theme configuration is located in [Theme](./src/theme.ts).

Forms are handled using React Form Hook with Zod are being used to forms, was used the "vanilla-masker" library to validate and format Brazilian CPF and phone number inputs efficiently.

#### **Unit testing**

Unit testing are implementated for verify how is working StorageManager, are important tests case to validates the integrity of the core of the app [see tests](./services/__tests__)

## Installing / Getting started
