# Teste de Front-end

> Additional information or tag line

A brief description of your project, what it is used for.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This installs all dependencies and starts the local development server.

## Developing

### Built With

- React
- TypeScript
- NextJS
- Vite
- Vitest

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Git

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
pnpm install
```

This clones the repository, navigates into the project folder, and installs dependencies.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. For example:

```shell
pnpm run build
```

This compiles the TypeScript and bundles the project for production using Vite.

### Deploying / Publishing

To publish or deploy a new version:

```shell
pnpm run deploy
```

This command should handle deploying your project to the target server or platform.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.  
For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](/tags).

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

## Tests

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing.

To run the tests:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

These tests ensure that key parts of the application logic behave as expected.

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## API Reference

If the API is external, link to API documentation.  
If not, describe your API including authentication methods and endpoints with their required parameters.

## Database

Explain what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.  
Document your database design, schemas, and relationships here.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the **MIT License** â€“ see the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.
